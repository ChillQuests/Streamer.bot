# How to...

This Action/Sub-Action will allow you to set a trigger on your "StreamOnline" event within Streamer.bot that will pull the current stream info, perform a lookup against the SteamDB via API call to gather the game's header image from Steam, then create a new eye-popping 
Dicord Event within your server so anyone that is hanging out in your Discord will know that you are currently live!

Here's a screenshot of what a LIVE Event looks like in Discord when your Twitch stream goes live using this offering:

When someon clicks on "Event Details", they will see all of the ... well, event details, including a nice image of the Steam provided game header image if one exists!

The easiest way to install this offering is to use the Streamer.Bot "Import" function and copy/paste the contents of "import-code.txt" found [here](https://github.com/ChillQuests/Streamer.bot/blob/main/src/twitch-golive-create-scheduled-event/import-code.txt).
