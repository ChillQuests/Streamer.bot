# StreamerBot Custom Actions

This repository is more of a sandbox that contains a combination of C# code and importable scripts that can be used to execute logic from StreamerBot actions.

NOTE: I write code for a living, but please don't judge the ugliness of these offerings - I'm not going for elegance and my 'career coding standards' are MUCH higher than what you'll see here. :)
